This project is a basic recreation of the google.com homepage using basic HTML/CSS. 

My biggest struggle with this project was centering and positioning with CSS. 

I've pretty much finished the project, but I'm still not convinced that the centered content (the logo and search box) are actually positioned correctly, but are just kinda center-ish. However, I think they're close enough to consider myself done enough to move on to the javascript portion of TOP.

I considered going all out and adding the magnifying glass/microphone images to the search bar, as well as adding the shadow hover effect. However, I dont' want to spend too much extra time, knowing these are things that I can accomplish with a simple google search.
